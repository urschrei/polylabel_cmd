# Polylabel_Cmd
â€¦is the command-line version of [Polylabel](https://github.com/urschrei/polylabel-rs). Install it using `cargo install polylabel_cmd`.  
This gives you the `polylabel` command.

## Use
Polylabel takes one mandatory argument: a path to a valid GeoJSON file, containing any of:

- a `FeatureCollection` containing `Feature`s which are valid Polygons or MultiPolygons
- a `Feature` containing a valid Polygon or MultiPolygon
- a `Geometry` which is a valid Polygon or MultiPolygon.

Any non-(Multi)Polygon content is ignored.  

It also accepts an optional `-t` or `--tolerance` switch, allowing you to fine-tune the tolerance from the default `0.001`. Smaller tolerances take longer to calculate.   

Output is a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` containing `Point` geometries, in the same order as the input geometries. Note that if the input contained `MultiPolygon`s, the output will be longer as these geometries are individually processed.

## Speed
Polylabel is fast. Polygons are processed in parallel, using [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon).

## Binaries
Will be available when I set up CI.

## TODO
- Retain `properties` in output
